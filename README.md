# Hi for Messenger

This was an app I made to teach myself Swift and explore the Messenger API. The app functions like the giphy bot from Slack, allowing you to one-tap send a random gif based on a set list of emotions (configurable from a Parse app), or to type in your own custom emoji.

Check it out on the app store:
